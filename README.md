# NFLStats
The basis behind the build is to create a next gen stats sheet using the nfl_data_py file. Included in the repo is three examples using QuaterBack (QB)  stats, Running Back (RB) stats, and receving stats. The idea in the future is to be able to break out Tight ends (TE), Running backs and Wide Receviers (WR) to show each postions receving stats.
